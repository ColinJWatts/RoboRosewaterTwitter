To protect secrets .txt have been omitted from the git repo.

All three apis used in this project require some kind of authentication. 
To Use this bot you will be required to set up secret files of your own for each 
of these interfaces. You will also be required to point the config file at each of them

The format of each secret file is shown below:

TWITTER:
{
    "CONSUMER_KEY": "PUT CONSUMER KEY HERE", 
    "CONSUMER_SECRET": "PUT CONSUMER SECRET HERE", 
    "ACCESS_KEY": "PUT ACCESS KEY HERE", 
    "ACCESS_SECRET": "PUT ACCESS SECRET HERE"
}

GOOGLE DRIVE: (note this file can be downloaded directly from google's developer tools with no changes)
{
    "installed":
    {
        "client_id":"client id goes here",
        "project_id":"your google developer project id",
        "auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
        "token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
        "auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
        "client_secret":"client secret goes here",
